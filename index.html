            <p><em><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong></em> is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
            <p>A <em><strong>document</strong></em> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Presenting a document</strong></em> to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>
            <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
            <header>CSS syntax</header>
            <article>

            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>
            <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
            <code>h1 {<br>
                color: red;<br>
                font-size: 5em;<br>
            }
            </code>
            <p>The rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (&lt;h1>).</p>
            <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more <em><strong>declarations</strong></em>, which take the form of <em><strong>property</strong></em> and <em><strong>value</strong></em> pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
            <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
            <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
            <code>h1 {<br>
                color: red;<br>
                font-size: 5em;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            p {<br>
                color: black;<br>
            }<br>
            </code>

            </section>
            
        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document:">
                <header>Adding CSS to our document:</header>
                <article>

                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across.</p>

                <ul>
                <li><section class="main-section" id="External_stylesheet">
                    <header><em>External stylesheet</em></header>

                            <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet.</p>
                            <p>You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML <link> element:</p>
                            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html><br>
                                &lt;html><br>
                                &lt;head><br>
                                &lt;meta charset="utf-8"><br>
                                &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title><br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"><br>
                                &lt;/head><br>
                                &lt;body><br>
                                &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1><br>
                                &lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p><br>
                                &lt;/body><br>
                                &lt;/html></code>

                            <p>The CSS stylesheet file might look like this:</p>
                            <code>h1 {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                background-color: yellow;<br>
                                border: 1px solid black;<br>
                              }<br>
                              <br>
                              p {<br>
                                color: red;<br>
                              }</code>
                            <p>The href attribute of the <link> element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it somewhere else and adjust the path. Here are three examples:</p>
                            <code>&lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called styles inside the current directory --><br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"><br>
                                <br>
                                &lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called general, which is in a subdirectory called styles, inside the current directory --><br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/general/style.css"><br>
                                <br>
                                &lt;!-- Go up one directory level, then inside a subdirectory called styles --><br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css"></code> 
                            </section>
                            </li>

                <li><section class="main-section" id="Internal_stylesheet">
                        <header><em>Internal stylesheet</em></header>

                    <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a &lt;style> element contained inside the HTML &lt;head>.</p>
                    <p>The HTML for an internal stylesheet might look like this:</p>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html><br>
                        &lt;html><br>
                            &lt;head><br>
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"><br>
                            &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title><br>
                            &lt;style><br>
                              h1 {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                                background-color: yellow;<br>
                                border: 1px solid black;<br>
                              }<br>
                              <br>
                              p {<br>
                                color: red;<br>
                              }<br>
                              &lt;/style><br>
                              &lt;/head><br>
                              &lt;body><br>
                              &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1><br>
                              &lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p><br>
                              &lt;/body><br>
                              &lt;/html></code>
                    <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.</p>
                    <p>But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way of working. To apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must have an internal stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. The efficiency penalty carries over to site maintenance too. With CSS in internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one simple styling change may require edits to multiple web pages.</p>
                        
                </section>
                </li>
                
               <li><section class="main-section" id="Inline_styles">
                        <header><em>Inline styles</em></header>

                    <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:</p>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html><br>
                        &lt;html><br>
                        &lt;head><br>
                        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"><br>
                        &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title><br>
                        &lt;/head><br>
                        &lt;body><br>
                        &lt;h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;">Hello World!&lt;/h1><br>
                        &lt;p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;/body><br>
                        &lt;/html></code>
                    <p><em><strong>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible.</strong></em> It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.</p>
                    <p>There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.</p>

            <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an <em><strong>element selector</strong></em> — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>
            <code>p {<br>
                color: green;<br>
              }</code>
            <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
            <code>p, li {<br>
                color: green;<br>
            }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Changing_the_default_behavior_of_elements">
                <header>Changing the default behavior of elements</header>
                <article>

                <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.</p>
                <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks.</p>
                <p>A good example is our &lt;ul>, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:</p>
                <code>li {<br>
                    list-style-type: none;<br>
                  }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
                    <header>Adding a class</header>
                    <article>

                    <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
                    <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
                    <code> &lt;ul><br>
                        &lt; li>Item one &lt;/li><br>
                        &lt; li class="special">Item two &lt;/li><br>
                        &lt; li>Item &lt; em>three &lt;/em> &lt;/li><br>
                        &lt; /ul></code>
                    <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
                    <code>.special {<br>
                        color: orange;<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                      }</code>
                    <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>
                    <p>You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the <span> in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</p>
                    <code>li.special {<br>
                        color: orange;<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                      }</code>
                    <p>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <span> or another element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</p>
                    <code>li.special,<br>
                        span.special {<br>
                          color: orange;<br>
                          font-weight: bold;<br>
                        }</code>
                    <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>

                        <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. In our document are two &lt;em> elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an &lt;em> that is nested inside an &lt;li> element I can use a selector called the <em><strong>descendant combinator</strong></em>, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.</p>
                        <p>Add the following rule to your stylesheet.</p>
                        <code>li em {<br>
                            color: rebeccapurple;<br>
                          }</code>
                        <p>This selector will select any &lt;em> element that is inside (a descendant of) an &lt;li>. So in your example document, you should find that the &lt;em> in the third list item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>
                        <p>Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at the same hierarchy level in the HTML. To do so place a +  (an <em><strong>adjacent sibling combinator</strong></em>) between the selectors.</p>
                        <p>Try adding this rule to your stylesheet as well:</p>
                        <code>h1 + p {<br>
                            font-size: 200%;<br>
                          }</code>

                        <p>The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things based on their state. A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style a link we need to target the &lt;a> (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited links green.</p>
                        <code>a:link {<br>
                            color: pink;<br>
                          }<br>
                          <br>
                          a:visited {<br>
                            color: green;<br>
                          }</code>
                        <p>You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example removing the underline, which is achieved by in the next rule:</p>
                        <code>a:hover {<br>
                            text-decoration: none;<br>
                          }</code>
                        <p>We have removed the underline on our link on hover. You could remove the underline from all states of a link. It is worth remembering however that in a real site, you want to ensure that visitors know that a link is a link. Leaving the underline in place, can be an important clue for people to realize that some text inside a paragraph can be clicked on — this is the behavior they are used to. As with everything in CSS, there is the potential to make the document less accessible with your changes — we will aim to highlight potential pitfalls in appropriate places.</p>

                            <article>

                        <p>It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and combinators together. For example:</p>
                        <code>/* selects any  &lt;span> that is inside a  &lt;p>, which is inside an  &lt;article>  */<br>
                            article p span { ... }<br>
                            <br>
                            /* selects any &lt;p> that comes directly after a  &lt;ul>, which comes directly after an  &lt;h1>  */<br>
                            h1 + ul + p { ... }</code>
                        <p>You can combine multiple types together, too. Try adding the following into your code:</p>
                        <code>body h1 + p .special {<br>
                            color: yellow;<br>
                            background-color: black;<br>
                            padding: 5px;<br>
                          }</code>
                        <p>This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a &lt;p>, which comes just after an &lt;h1>, which is inside a &lt;body>. Phew!</p>
                        <p>In the original HTML we provided, the only element styled is &lt;span class="special">.</p>
                        <p>Don't worry if this seems complicated at the moment — you'll soon start to get the hang of it as you write more CSS.</p>

                        <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
                            <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.</li>
                            <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
                            <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
                            <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following diagram also offers a simple view of the process.</p>
